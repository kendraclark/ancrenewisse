EETS description:
117 parchment leaves. Two leaves (the central opening of the second quire) missing after f. 14. 215 x 148 mm. (after rebinding); written space c. 156 x 95 mm. (ff. 1-68), 156 x 100 (ff. 69-117), single column of 28 lines. Coloured initials and paragraph-marks (red and blue). Carefully written in a smaller Gothic book hand, dated by Ker, Tolkien 1962, p. xv) to the first half of the thirteenth century. Dialect localized by Jeremy Smith to northern Herefordshire or southern Shropshire (see Millett 1996a, p. 11, fn. 7). In the bottom margin of f. 1v, an ex libris inscription added towards the end of the thirteenth century records the gift of the MS by John Purcel (a Shropshire landowner) to the house of Victorine canons at Wigmore Abbey in Herefordshire, at the request of its precentor, Walter of Ludlow (see Ker, Tolkien (1962), pp. xvii-xviii). The MS includes minor corrections, alterations, and marginalia in hands of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; further annotations were added in the sixteenth century, when it was owned by Archbishop Parker. On Parkerï¿½s death in 1575 it passed to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.
The MS is rather larger and more carefully-produced than the other early MSS of AW, and its text is generally of high quality, although not free of errors (mainly of omission). It reflects a major (though not comprehensive) overhaul of the work for a changed audience, the group of twenty or more anchoresses addressed in a unique addition in Part 4 (ff. 69r/12--69v/11), now apparently regularly visited by the friars (ff. 16v/13-17r/2, 112v/10-14). It brings together most of the revisions and additions found elsewhere in the MS tradition, sometimes developing them further, and also includes some added material not found elsewhere. The main alterations to the text, much of which remains largely untouched, are in Parts 2, 4 and 8. Part 4 includes an expanded account of the offspring of the Seven Deadly Sins (also found in L, MS P, and MS V), and some direct addresses to the larger group of anchoresses (found only in MS A); there are also three substantial additions (shared with MS F, and in one case MS V as well) in Part 2. Part 8, the most thoroughly worked-over section, takes further the revisions to the 'Outer Rule' made by C2 in MS C; most of these further revisions are also found in L.
